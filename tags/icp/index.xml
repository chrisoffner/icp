      <description>The construction Arthur &amp;amp; Vassilvitskii use to prove their $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound for the ICP algorithm in $\mathbb{R}$ uses a point configuration they call The Linear Shifter over which ICP is supposed to require $|B|$ iterations to terminate.
However, I&amp;rsquo;m having some issues getting this to work as intended, which seem to stem from my trouble reconciling two interpretations of the relative translation between iterations.
Previously we have discussed the following lemma by Ezra, Efrat, and Sharir.</description>

      <description>Although the construction by Ezra et al. does support the claimed $\Theta (n \log n)$ running time, the proof via induction contains some bugs that we attempt to account for here.
üå∞ In a nutshell  We define a round $j$ as the sequence of iterations in which any points cross the Voronoi boundary $\beta_{n-j+1}$ between the cells $\mathcal{V}(b_{n-j+1})$ and $\mathcal{V}(b_{n-j+2})$. There exist $n-1$ voronoi boundaries $\beta_{n-j+1}$ between the $n$ adjacent points $b \in B$, for $j = n, n-1, &amp;hellip;, 2$.</description>

      <description>The proof starts off by defining a round $j$:
 Assume that the points of $A$, except for the leftmost one, are assigned to $b_{n‚àíj+1}$ and $b_{n‚àíj+2}$, for some $1 \le j \le n$ (clearly, these assignments can involve only two consecutive Voronoi cells), and consider all iterations of the algorithm, in which some points of $A$ cross the common Voronoi boundary $\beta_{n‚àíj+1}$ of the cells $\mathcal{V}(b_{n‚àíj+1}), \mathcal{V}(b_{n‚àíj+2})$. We call the sequence of these iterations round $j$ of the algorithm.</description>

      <description>‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è These are my study notes for theorem 4.1 of On the performance of the ICP algorithm by Ezra et al. in which I try to retrace their proof.
These notes are still very much incomplete and a work in progress.
ü§î Question about theorem 4.1 ü§î   ü§î Question about seeming contradiction ü§î   Round $j$ ist the sequence of all iterations, in which any points of $A$ cross the common Voronoi boundary $\beta_{n-j+1}$ of the cells $\mathcal{V}(b_{n-j+1}), \mathcal{V}(b_{n-j+2})$.</description>

      <description>In their paper On the ICP Algorithm the authors Esther Ezra, Micha Sharir, and Alon Efrat write:
 Lemma 2.3 At each iteration $i \ge 2$ of the algorithm, the relative translation vector $\Delta t_i$ satisfies
$$\boldsymbol{\Delta t_i} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{\boldsymbol{a} \in A} \left(N_B(\boldsymbol{a} + \boldsymbol{t_{i-1}}) - N_B(\boldsymbol{a} + \boldsymbol{t_{i-2}})\right),$$
where $\boldsymbol{t_j} = \sum_{k=1}^j \boldsymbol{\Delta t_k}.$
Proof Follows using easy algebraic manipulations, based on the obvious equality that follows by construction</description>

      <description>To get a better intuition of what the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm does, let&amp;rsquo;s look at a visual representation of its simplest form ‚Äì the one-dimensional case which is only concerned with translation, but not rotation.
Problem definition Let $A = \{{\boldsymbol{a_1}, &amp;hellip;, \boldsymbol{a_m}\}}, B = \{{\boldsymbol{b_1}, &amp;hellip;, \boldsymbol{b_n} \}}$ be two point sets in $d$-space, in the following illustration $d = 1$, and suppose that the ICP algorithm aligns $A$ to $B$, i.</description>
